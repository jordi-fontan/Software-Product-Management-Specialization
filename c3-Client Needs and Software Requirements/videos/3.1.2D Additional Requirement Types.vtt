[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:09.720
The next type of requirement, which we
will cover, is an External Interface.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.690
The idea behind this
requirement is simple.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.620
Often, your product belongs
to a larger system.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.320
External interfaces simply outline
where the product is situated.

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.630
We don't mean this in terms of
physical location, but in terms of

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
where the product sits logically among
other entities outside the product.

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.400
The interfaces also describe the way
in which these connections are made.

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.850
Through media, protocols, formats,
and levels of a compatibility.

10
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.120
Simply put,
this just means that an external interface

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.080
shows how the product itself relates
to something else in the system.

12
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.140
Say you had a software application, which
displayed information to an end user and

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.580
accessed a remote database.

14
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.050
The application sets between
the database and the end user, and

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.150
has an external interface to each one.

16
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.620
The external interfaces will show
the protocols which the application needs

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.850
to interact with the database,

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510
as well as how the information
should be presented to the user.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.829
External interfaces are often
identified on data flow diagrams.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.020
A data flow diagram is one which shows
all the components of a product in one

21
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.030
place and makes explicit reference
to how data is passed to and

22
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.580
from outside entities in the whole system.

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.910
External interfaces, then, are just
a description of the logical placement

24
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.730
of your product among other
entities within an entire system.

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.230
Don't confuse external interfaces with
the physical location of the product.

26
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.680
This is actually a separate type of
requirement called the product's

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.400
Physical Setting.

28
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.900
Physical Setting Requirements describe
how the product should be designed

29
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.470
around its physical environment.

30
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.830
For example,
if you were to develop a GPS tracker for

31
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.730
construction equipment in the Sahara,
you would want to make sure that it can

32
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.010
withstand extreme heat,
dust, noise, and vibrations.

33
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.360
If you were developing this system for
applications in Antarctica,

34
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.609
then you would want the product
to withstand extreme cold.

35
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.270
All of these are considerations made when
specifying physical setting requirements.

36
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.350
Which of the following would be considered
an external interface requirement?

37
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.920
A. The product must be able to communicate
to a customer database and an ad server.

38
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.880
B. The product must be able to remain
on battery power for six hours.

39
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.450
C. The product must be
able to withstand impact

40
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.780
from a drop of no less than fifty meters.

41
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.610
Or D. The product must withstand
full sunlight for ten hours per day.

42
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.010
The answer is A.

43
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.030
Remember, an external interface is
a requirement which specifies how

44
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.740
the product is to communicate or connect
with other components of the system.

45
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.250
By communicating with
a customer database and

46
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.229
an ad server, the product's external
interfaces are being defined.

47
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.600
Say you've specified all the requirements
we talked about earlier.

48
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.580
Is your development team capable of
creating the product you designed?

49
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.230
Knowing the answer to this
question is very important.

50
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.861
[SOUND] Development constraints
outline the implementation technology,

51
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.082
conventions, documentation, and
the process which your team will use.

52
00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:49.669
[SOUND] They could also address
things like, which devices or

53
00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.592
platforms the development team will
support, or how much memory, bandwidth, or

54
00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:57.357
processing power they're limited to using.

55
00:03:57.357 --> 00:04:01.593
It's usually best to specify this
later in the specification phase so

56
00:04:01.593 --> 00:04:06.280
that the product does not become limited
in vision by available technology.

57
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.930
Technology advances, therefore,
so should the product.

58
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.470
By discussing developing constraints last,
you can avoid the possibility

59
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.600
that you design prematurely with
old technologies and abilities.

60
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.420
In this lesson, we learned about the
different types of requirements available

61
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.850
to us,
which can express our client's needs.

62
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.400
Let's review.

63
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.750
First, we talked about requirement types,
which can influence your project.

64
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.360
Those requirements are business
requirements and business rules.

65
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.910
Then, we talked about a few of
the core requirement types.

66
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.642
Those were our user requirements,
functional requirements and

67
00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:50.107
non-functional requirements.

68
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.550
Finally, we talked about a few
requirements, which provide

69
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.880
additional context for the eventual
design and implementation of the product.

70
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.698
Those are external interfaces,
the physical product setting, and

71
00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:05.250
development constraints.

72
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.510
Next, we'll talk about how we can
manage changing requirements and

73
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.760
control our product's scope.
